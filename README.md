## Features

- **Three Difficulty Levels**: Hangmoji offers three challenging difficulty levels to suit your preferences:
  - Easy: Guess a 4-letter word.
  - Normal: Guess a 5-letter word.
  - Hard: Guess a 7-letter word.

- **Emoji Clues**: Each level provides emoji clues to give you a hint about the word you need to guess. Can you decipher the emojis and solve the puzzle?

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Enjoy a user-friendly and interactive gameplay experience. Simply tap on the letters to guess the word, and watch as your progress is revealed on the hangman's scaffold.

## How to Play

1. Select your desired difficulty level: Easy, Normal, or Hard.
2. Observe the emoji clues to help you guess the word.
3. Start guessing letters one by one. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed; if not, you'll inch closer to completing the hangman.
4. Keep guessing until you solve the word or run out of attempts. Be careful not to let the hangman meet his fate!
